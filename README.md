# Application based on a microservices architecture
Microservices created with Spring Framework

To design an application based on a microservices architecture, we have used:

* Domain Driven Design
* Events with RabbitMQ and Spring AMQP
* Discovering services using Eureka
* Routing with the API Gateway pattern using Zuul
* Circuit Breakers with Hystrix
* Load balancing using Ribbon
* Creation and execution of tests using Cucumber
